##### Framework/Library/Technology
- Gin
  - HTTP web framework
- sqlc
  - generate idiomatic Golang codes, which uses the standard database/sql library
  - catch SQL errors before generating codes (sqlx failure won't occur until runtime)
  - only full supports Postgres
- JWT
  - token-based authentication
  - a base64 encoded string, composed of 3 main parts
    - the header of the token, include the token type JWT, and the algorithm used to sign the token (ex: HS256)
    - the payload data include information about the logged-in user (username, issued at, expired at)
    - the digital signature
  - digital signature algorithms
    - Symmetric-key algorithm
      - same secret key is used to both sign and verify the tokens.
      - cannot use it in case thereâ€™s an external third-party service that wants to verify the token
    - Asymmetric-key algorithm
      - a pair of keys:
        - The private key is used to sign the token 
        - the public key is used only to verify it. 
      - can easily share our public key with any external third-party services
  - Problems of JWT
    - Weak algorithms
      - gives developers too many algorithms to choose from, including the algorithms that are already known to be vulnerable
    - Trivial Forgery
      - an attacker can just set the alg header to none so the request can bypass the signature verification process.
      - set the algorithm header to a symmetric-key one
- PASETO
  - token-based authentication
  - PASETO structure
    - PASETO structure
      - PASETO version (ex: v2)
      - the purpose of the token (ex: local (symmetric-key authenticated encryption algorithm) or public (Asymmetric-key))
      - PASETO payload data (encrypted), can be decrypted using secret key
        - the payload body. (ex: a simple message and the expiration time of the token)
        - the nonce value ("number used once",  value that varies with time to verify that specific values are not reused) 
        that is used in both encryption and message authentication process.
        - the message authentication tag to authenticate the encrypted message and its associated unencrypted data.
      - the footer (optional) (not encrypted): can store any public information 
  - the best-secured alternative to JWT
    - Strong algorithms
      - Don't have to choose algorithm, only version of PASETO (ex: v1 or v2)
        - v1: used for legacy systems that cannot use modern cryptography
        - v2: more secured and modern algorithms are being used
    - Non-trivial forgery
      - algorithm header does not exist anymore, so the attacker cannot set it to none
- golang-migrate
  - database migration
- enumer
  - generate Go code that adds useful methods to Go enums
- mapstructure
  - decoding generic map values to structures and vice versa, while providing helpful error handling
- decimal
  - Arbitrary-precision fixed-point decimal numbers in go.
- Viper
  - Viper is a complete configuration solution for Go applications
- testify
  - Unit test
- gomock
  - mocking framework
- CI (Github Actions)
- [Docker](docker.md)
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)
- [AWS](aws.md)
- ./wait-for 
  - a script designed to synchronize services like docker containers.
