##### gPRC
- gPRC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
    - Remote Procedure Call Framework
      - The client can execute a remote procedure on the server 
      - The remote interaction code is handled by gPRC 
      - The API & data structure code is automatically generated 
      - Support multiple programming languages 
    - Originally developed by Google
      - Now is part of CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) 
- Works
    - Define API & data structure
      - The RPC and its request/response structure are defined using protobuf  
    - Generate gRPC stubs  
      - Generate codes for the server and client in the language of your choice
    - Implement the server
      - Implement the gPRC handler on the server side
    - Use the client
      - Use the generated client stubs to call the RPC on the server
- 3 Why 
  - High performance
    - HTTP/2: binary framing, multiplexing, header compression, bidirectional communication 
  - Strong API contract
    - Server & client share the same protobuf RPC definition with strongly typed data
  - Automatic code generation
    - Codes that serialize/deserialize data, or transfer data between client & server are automatically generated
- 4 Types
  - Unary gRPC 
    - The client sends 1 request, and the server replies with 1 response (same as normal HTTP API) 
  - Client streaming gPRC
    - The client sends a stream of messages, and the server replies with 1 response
  - Server streaming gPRC
    - The client sends 1 request, and the server replies with a stream of messages
  - Bidirectional streaming gPRC
    - The client sends a stream of messages, and the server replies with a stream of messages,
    in parallel and with arbitrary order
- gRPC Gateway
  - Serve both gRPC and HTTP requests at once
    - A plugin of protobuf compiler 
    - Generate proxy codes from protobuf
    - Translate HTTP JSON calls to gPRC
      - In-process translation: only for unary 
      - Separate proxy server: both unary and streaming
    - Write code once, serve both gRPC and HTTP requests
