- Docker
  - an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
  - separate applications from infrastructure to deliver software quickly
  - manage infrastructure in the same ways as manage applications
  - reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
  - Docker Container
- Docker platform
  - package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container
  - Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, 
  so it does not rely on what is currently installed on the host
  - easily share containers, and others gets the same container that works in the same way.
  - provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of containers
  - Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, 
    - Develop application and its supporting components using containers.
    - Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
    - The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing application
    - When ready, deploy application into production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service.
      This works the same whether production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two
- Use cases
  - Fast, consistent delivery of applications
  - Responsive deployment and scaling 
  - Running more workloads on the same hardware
- Docker architecture
  - uses a client-server architecture 
- Docker daemon 
  - listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes
  - can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services
- Docker client
  - is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker
  - sends these commands to the Docker daemon
- Docker registries 
  - stores Docker images 
  - Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use
  - Docker daemon 
  - Docker daemon 
- Docker objects
  - Docker Images 
    - a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container 
  - Docker Containers 
    - a runnable instance of an imag
- Dockerfile
  - Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile
- Docker Compose file
  - a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application
